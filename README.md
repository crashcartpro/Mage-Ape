Mage Ape
========

### What?

Mage Ape is a web interface for testing API calls to Magento stores and sites

Magento is an extensable e-ecomerce framework with many moving parts. Just one such part is the SOAP or XML-RPC based API interface. Which allows 3rd party programs to access store content.

However, sometimes things fail. Mage Ape wants to help you troubleshoot.

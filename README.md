### Todo / Road Map

* ~~Start project~~
* ~~landing page can enter target site and pull SOAP wsld info~~
* ~~sanitizeand simplify URL input~~
* check and fetch store info in "step one"
* select an available SOAP method?
* ~~add user/pass feilds~~
* ~~make authed function calls in "step 2"~~
* ~~trap and report errors for troubleshooting~~
* check that url actually resolves before doing anything else.
* keep a more detailed log of calls and responces, and print it out after all tests complete.
* optional switch for Magento SOAP v1 or SOAP v2
* more optional switches for XML-RPC?
* ~~have the form retain previous values after submiting~~
